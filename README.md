# tweetula-twitterbot-v1
A simple twitter-bot which get 2 historic events of the current date[one is the the first recorded event  and the other is the last recorded event] and then choses a random time [from 7am to 9pm] and then  creates a cron-job  [just to add a little bit of human factor to it]
